This is relatively simple, follow the instructions from https://game.ci/docs/github/getting-started to get your Unity License keys to
be able to build on github.

Update the .github workflow files to replace:
'UnityGameServer/Assets/**', 'UnityGameServer/Packages/**', 'UnityGameServer/ProjectSettings/**'

With the actual paths for your project. This is just a boiler plate for me. Use at your own risk.
